        <h3> Industrial Project</h3>
        <p>Agriculture is full of uncertainty due to climate change, ground water deficiency, rainfall. Crop yield prediction in agriculture is a very big dilemma and there is a huge dataset where farmers find it difficult to predict the yield and seed selection. In today's situation due to increase in the population, the production of grains and agricultural products needs to be increased simultaneously to meet the demands of the people. For sustainable agricultural management,  factors like remote sensing can be of great use for their assessment and management. This technology has manifold applications in agriculture including soil temperature , ph , humidity,  rainfall under changing climatic scenarios. For achieving the solution we have restructured the problem into subproblems. Machine Learning based solutions are developed to solve the difficulties faced by the farmers. The real time environmental parameters are collected and crop yield is being predicted using KNN Algorithm. We have made both web based as well as app based methods so that they can be accessed at any time from anywhere. The App named as KIsan Giyan as well as the web based application will detect which crop can be grown based on the aforementioned parameters through remote sensing. The farmers or their representatives can operate smart gadgets such as smartphones, since most of the day to day activities are done using mobile apps. So farmers can use it to grow their crop significantly in the competitive edge.

            <h3> Final year Project</h3>
            <p>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be used to generate a photo-realistic image from a low-dimension random noise. Such a synthesized (fake) image with inappropriate content can be used on social media networks, which can cause severe problems. With the aim to successfully detect fake images, an effective and efficient image forgery detector is necessary. However, conventional image forgery detectors fail to recognize fake images generated by the GAN-based generator since these images are generated and manipulated from the source image. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for detecting the fake images by using the contrastive loss. First, several state-of-the-art GANs are employed to generate the fakeâ€“real image pairs. Next, the reduced DenseNet is developed to a two-streamed network structure to allow pairwise information as the input. Then, the proposed common fake feature network is trained using the pairwise learning to distinguish the features between the fake and real images. Finally, a classification layer is concatenated to the proposed common fake feature network to detect whether the input image is fake or real. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperformed other state-of-the-art fake image detectors.
